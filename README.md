# Rock Physical Properties for Rock Type Classification

## DSCI 100 Project Final Report
## Group 4: Naijide Anwaer, Maggie Ruan, Yun Xing
## Date: December 07, 2021

As our first data science group project, we applied K-nearnest neighbour algorithum to answer a classification problem: given the physical properties data of a rock, whether it will be igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.
We built the model with iterative process and different visualization techniques are applied throught the process. Feel free to explore the final report:  RockType_PhysicalProperties_Project_FinalReport.ipynb 
and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
